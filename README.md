## About this project

This portfolio project showcases the use of HTML and CSS.  Utilizing foundational concepts to aid in all future projects going forward.  This portfolio highlighted how valuble a google search can be when it comes to using commands and technnologies you are not familiar with.

## HTML concepts used:

* Semantic HTML tags
* **Picture** element to render approprite sized images for responsiveness
* **Img** elements with appropriate use of **Alt** descriptions
* **A** tags with **ID's** for navigation and **mailto** links
* **UL** elements also for navigation

## CSS concepts used:

* CSS variables
* Overriding browser default styling
* Font sizes/families
* Flexbox
* Viewport height
* Background images
* Box-shadow
* Media queries
* Targeting HTML with **classes**, **ID's**, and **element** tags

This portfolio is one of many to come I'm sure.  It will no doubt evolve.  In it's current format all project entries are space holders only.  As I add to my repository, the **Projects** section will evolve to not only become active, but to become more aesthetic as well.

One of the challenges I encountered while building this project, was simply the design in general.  While I was provided with an image template to possibly build off of, I chose to utilize my own design.  I did this to gain perspective of designing a web page from scratch.  The creativity behind web design is a whole other component to web design.  This was eye opening for me.
